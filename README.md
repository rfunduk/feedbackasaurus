An extremely quick hack clone of http://redpen.io as a
'get comfortable with Clojure' exercise.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- Leiningen >= 1.7.0
- MongoDB running on localhost:27017 (the default)

Both can be had with one command via homebrew.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
